**All clients require this mod.**

## 🚧 Roadmap
- Continue polishing the model and textures, if necessary
- Implement an emissive warning texture overlay (I tried, but it didn't work yet)
- Refine custom sounds

I will be focusing on my submission for the R.E.P.O. Winter Mod Jam, so this is low on my priority list at the moment.

## 🔧 Configuration
This mod is highly configurable! Config options will automatically apply if changed in-game, especially if using REPOConfig.
